2/5:
this is my second project 
I'll be using HTML, CSS, and JS
the idea of the website is a popularuty challenge between people and the winner is going to win by votes
I'm going to test my self in JS for the first time
and I'll document every thing daily here.
2/6:
I was done with the main-page, and the design of the rest of the pages.
2/7:
I'm working in the first page which is going to be the men vote, and working in JS to make the standings.
